# LogAnywhere Project Roadmap

_LogAnywhere is a log-agnostic routing layer for embedded and systems-level C++._  
All log destinations (serial, BLE, MQTT, etc.) build on a shared dispatch core with strict design constraints:

---
## Platform-Agnostic Design Constraints

- Only C++11 standard headers & features
- Handler-driven routing (`void(const LogMessage&, void*)`)
- Optional transport/formatter extensions sit outâ€‘ofâ€‘core

Compatibility targets:
- Arduino / ESP32  
- Linux CLI tools  
- Bareâ€‘metal MCUs  
- RTOS systems (FreeRTOS, Zephyr)

---
# Roadmap

## v1.0 (Complete)
- âœ… Core routing by level + tag

---
## v1.1 (In Progress)
- âœ… Tag-based dispatching
- ðŸ”² Tuning RAM vs. Speed configurations

---
## v1.2 (Next Up)
- ðŸ”² Async / ring-buffer backend
- ðŸ”² Built-in reference handlers (Serial, MQTT)
- ðŸ”² Structured-log output (JSON / CBOR layer)

---
## v2.0+ (Future / Backlog)
- ðŸ”² Dynamic log-level switching
- ðŸ”² Thread-safe dispatch & compile-time stripping
- ðŸ”² Extended metadata injection (source file, function)
- ðŸ”² Crash-resilient ring buffer with persistent IDs
- ðŸ”² BLE log broadcaster
